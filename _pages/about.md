I am a Ph.D. student (2021.09 - present) at the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment (SKLSDE) and <a href="https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/">School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE)</a>
<a href="https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/"></a>, <a href="https://www.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a>, Beijing, China, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://iai.buaa.edu.cn/info/1013/1093.htm">Wenjun Wu</a>. Before that, I obtained my BSc degree in 2020
from
<a href="https://www.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a> (<i>Awarded Outstanding Graduate & Honor Student</i>).

Research
======

<p >
    I am interested in <strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</strong> and their applications. My research goal is to develop GNN models that are general, efficient, and explainable.
</p>
Currently, my research focuses on the following areas:
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Heterophilic GNN</strong>: Exploring GNN architectures that can effectively handle graphs with different types of nodes or edges, enabling the modeling of diverse relationships in complex networks.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Interpretable GNN</strong>: Developing GNN models that provide interpretability and transparency in their decision-making process, allowing users to understand the underlying factors influencing the
        predictions and actions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Graph Transformer</strong>: Investigating the integration of transformer-based architectures into GNNs, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and improve the expressive
        power of GNN models.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Dynamic Graph Neural Networks</strong>: Extending GNNs to handle dynamic graphs where the underlying structure changes over time. Adapting GNN architectures to incorporate temporal information and capture
        evolving patterns in dynamic networks.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Practical Problems</strong>: Applying graph algorithms in solving real-world problems, such as analyzing students' collaborative learning patterns and implementing knowledge tracing for students. Leveraging
        graph-based techniques to extract meaningful insights from educational data and improve learning outcomes.
    </li>
</ul>
By advancing these research areas, I aim to contribute to the development of GNNs that are versatile, efficient, and provide understandable reasoning, ultimately enabling their widespread adoption in various domains.

<!-- 1. **CLGT: A Graph Transformer for Student Performance Prediction in Collaborative Learning**

<strong>Tianhao Peng</strong>, Yu Liang, Wenjun Wu, Jian Ren, Zhao Pengrui, Yanjun Pu. <br><br> 

Accepted by <a href="https://aaai-23.aaai.org/">AAAI Symposium</a>, 2023 ï½œ <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/26893/26665">paper</a> -->

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
