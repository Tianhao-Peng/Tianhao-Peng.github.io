I am a Ph.D. student (2021.09 - present) at the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment (SKLSDE) and <a href="https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/">School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE)</a>
<a href="https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/"></a>, <a href="https://www.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a>, Beijing, China, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://iai.buaa.edu.cn/info/1013/1093.htm">Wenjun Wu</a>. Before that, I obtained my BSc degree in 2020
from
<a href="https://www.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a> (<i>Awarded Outstanding Graduate & Honor Student</i>).

Research
======

<p >
    I am interested in <strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</strong> and their applications. My research goal is to develop GNN models that are general, efficient, and explainable.
</p>
Currently, my research focuses on the following areas:
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Heterophilic GNN</strong>: Exploring GNN architectures that can effectively handle graphs with different types of nodes or edges, enabling the modeling of diverse relationships in complex networks.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Interpretable GNN</strong>: Developing GNN models that provide interpretability and transparency in their decision-making process, allowing users to understand the underlying factors influencing the
        predictions and actions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Graph Transformer</strong>: Investigating the integration of transformer-based architectures into GNNs, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and improve the expressive
        power of GNN models.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Dynamic Graph Neural Networks</strong>: Extending GNNs to handle dynamic graphs where the underlying structure changes over time. Adapting GNN architectures to incorporate temporal information and capture
        evolving patterns in dynamic networks.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Practical Problems</strong>: Applying graph algorithms in solving real-world problems, such as analyzing students' collaborative learning patterns and implementing knowledge tracing for students. Leveraging
        graph-based techniques to extract meaningful insights from educational data and improve learning outcomes.
    </li>
</ul>
By advancing these research areas, I aim to contribute to the development of GNNs that are versatile, efficient, and provide understandable reasoning, ultimately enabling their widespread adoption in various domains.
